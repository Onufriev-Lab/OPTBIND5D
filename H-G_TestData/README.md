# Host-Guest Files

## Overview
This folder contains essential testing files for evaluating new radii sets, OPTBIND5D on Host-Guest (H-G) systems that we used in our study. It includes 20 pairs of topology (.top with OPTBIND5D radii set) and coordinate (.crd) files. You can use the provided python code to update the radii set in your desired .top file and generate a new .prmtop file with OPTBIND5D radii set.

## Contents
- **Topology Files (.top)**: These files define the molecular structure, including atom types, charges, and bonds of the Host-Guest systems.
- **Coordinate Files (.crd)**: Accompanying each topology file, the coordinate files provide the positions of atoms in the Host-Guest systems.

## Purpose
The files are used to perform simulations and tests to assess the performance and accuracy of new radii sets in predicting binding affinities and other thermodynamic properties in complex molecular systems.

## How to Use
To use these files for testing:
1. Ensure you have the necessary simulation software installed that can read and process `.top` and `.crd` files.
2. Select a file pair to begin your simulation or testing.
3. Adjust simulation parameters as necessary to fit your testing regimen.
